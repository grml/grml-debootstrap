grml-debootstrap (0.82+nmu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  Starting with this release grml-debootstrap enables systemd-networkd by
  default on Debian/stretch systems.

  The old default behaviour where the host /etc/network/interfaces was used to
  deploy the target network configuration was dropped in favor of using the
  --defaultinterfaces option where all ethernet devices are configured to use
  DHCP via systemd-networkd. For legacy reasons we also provide a
  /etc/network/interfaces where `eth0` is configured to use DHCP.

grml-debootstrap (0.70) unstable; urgency=medium

  The 'contrib' and 'non-free' repositories are no longer
  enabled by default in COMPONENTS, so only 'main' is
  active by default.

  Please note that the firmware-linux package gets installed
  only if the non-free component is enabled.

  To re-enable the contrib and/or non-free repositories either
  use the new command line options --contrib + --non-free
  or set COMPONENTS='main contrib non-free' in grml-debootstrap's
  configuration file /etc/debootstrap/config

grml-debootstrap (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this release support for the Debian/etch release
  does not exist any longer.

  Starting with this release grml-debootstrap uses Grub2
  instead of Grub-legacy (v1).

  To simplify handling for the user the configuration variable
  GROOT was dropped and the syntax of GRUB slightly changed.
  Instead of the old grub syntax style 'hd0' you can use
  '/dev/sdX' for $GRUB nowadays. You don't have to care about
  that if you are using the interactive mode.
