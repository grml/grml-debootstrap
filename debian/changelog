    text as "stable" is invalid.
  * Use 'pri=0' as example for swap partition in /etc/fstab.

grml-debootstrap (0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * New features:
    - support setting Debian suite components (like main, contrib,...)
      through COMPONENTS so it's possible to use a simple 'main' mirror.
    - support setting aptitude/apt-get options through $DPKG_OPTIONS.
    - support selection of netinstall vs. local mirror in interactive menu
  * Bugfixes:
    - make sure to ignore /dev/md* devices if not using SW-RAID
    - do not fail in chrootmirror() when using $ISO variable.
    - change order of checkconfiguration() so we get the prompt/
      display for checking configuration again.
    - Drop 'do not prompt for partition dialog if swraid has been
      configured already' which doesn't make any sense in most situations
  * Minor changes:
    - check for mounted target in mkfs() step already instead of mount_target()
    - use '.. to the debootstrap command' in description of --debopt
    - chroot-script: put installation of kernel before installing additional
      packages so installation of kernel doesn't fail if the kernel directory
      exists already
  * Debian Package:
    - bump Standard Version to 3.8.1 (no further changes).

  * Make sure stopping a service inside chroot-script does not
    fail chroot-script itself.

grml-debootstrap (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support setting some variables via cmdline.
  * Support full automatic installation via debian2hd.
  * Change logic of function execution and improved error handling
    in some functions.
  * Use aptitude instead of apt-get in chroot-script, but
    only if it's available.
  * Use DEBIAN_FRONTEND='noninteractive' so we avoid unnecessary
    questions when installing. (Thanks, formorer!)
  * Added additional check to grub code for running sed on
    /boot/grub/menu.lst.
  * Updated TODO file.
  * Use asciidoc for manpage generation.
  * Added basic zsh-completion (thanks, ft!), but do not install it yet.
    We have to adjust $fpath in grml-etc-core first.

grml-debootstrap (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support Debian release with codename 'lenny'. Depend on
    debootstrap/cdebootstrap versions supporting lenny therefore.
  * Split all the code into separate functions.
  * Export LANG=C and LC_ALL=C as we don't have the locales inside
    the chroot when running grml-debootstrap. (Just a cosmetic
    change as there aren't any errors but warning messages from
    dpkg.)
  * Always assume architecture of the running system (overwriting
    via $ARCH is still supported of course).
  * Write variables from grml-debootstrap to /etc/debootstrap/variables
    and provide it to chroot-script.
  * Support stages. [Closes: issue151]

grml-debootstrap (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support Sarge and Sid as "$RELEASE"s as well.
  * Added 'debootstrap | cdebootstrap' and grml-etc-core to
    depends.
  * Added support for:
    - cdebootstrap [broken for sarge as $RELEASE, see #390510]
    - setting hostname via /etc/hostname
    - /etc/kernel-img.conf
    - support setting locales through /etc/debootstrap/locale.gen
  * Added ssh, mdadm and lvm2 to default package list.
  * Rewrote kernel package version handling (removed from package
    list to be able to support sarge as well).

 -- Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>  Fri,  3 Nov 2006 19:05:19 +0100
