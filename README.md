This tool is a wrapper suite around debootstrap and cdebootstrap
to ease installation of a pure [Debian](https://debian.org/) system.

Configuration can be done on the command line, in a dialog frontend
or in /etc/debootstrap/config. You will get a pure Debian system
installed on the specified device or directory, or directly into
an image file suitable for Virtual Machine use.
